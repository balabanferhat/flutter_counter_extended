Note: Why write a Cupertino app? The Material design language was created for any platform, not just Android. When you write a Material app in Flutter, it has the Material look and feel on all devices, even iOS. If you want your app to look like a standard iOS-styled app, then you would use the Cupertino library.

You can technically run a Cupertino app on either Android or iOS, but (due to licensing issues) Cupertino won't have the correct fonts on Android. For this reason, use an iOS-specific device when writing a Cupertino app.
